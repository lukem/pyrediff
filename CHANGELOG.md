# Change Log

## [16] - 2022-08-02

### Fixed
- Gracefully handle unknown `\g<group>` references in the PATTERN file.
- Capture unmatched optional `(?P<group>)` as empty strings,
  to avoid unknown `\g<group>` errors.
  For example, the pattern `(matched|(?P<other>))` that matches `matched`
  allows `\g<other>` to be used in a later pattern to match the empty string.
- Fix various pylint issues, maintaining python2 and python3 compatibility.

### Changed
- Enable github workflows:
  - Build: runs `configure`, `make`, `make check`.
  - Pylint: runs `pylint` for `pyrediff`.
